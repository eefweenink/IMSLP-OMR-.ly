Routines, using OMR (Optical Music Reading)  to turn pdfs from IMSLP Archive into correct Lilypond.files
# Steps in short: 
- Choose a pdf, image with readable music. If needed improve the quality of the file.
- Choose an OMR app. (for me: Audiveris or Musicscanner (IOS))
- Use Audiveris to create MXL file(s).
- Import MXL into Frescobaldi, use optimal CLI settings
- In Frescobaldi improve the quality untill satisfied.
- Finished

#Setup of apps
- Folderstructure
- Audiveris 5.6.1 (special update because of MacOs error)
- Frescobaldi latest version
